    "## 2.1 Variable and Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use string literals and number literals to run some tasks. Number literals are integers (such as `5`) or floats (such as `17.5`). For example: `print('Hi')` or ` 10 / 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many situations\n",
    "\n",
    "- you don't know the values when you write the program. You need to read the data from a file or from a user input. \n",
    "- When you defeine a function that consumes inputs and generates outputs, you need to refer to the input values and output values. \n",
    "- Even you have the values used in computation, you still should give it a meaningful name to make the code easier to understand. For example, it is unclear what's the meaning of `17.5` and `5`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You learned from middle school that algebra uses symbols to represent values and symbols are more powerful in solving problems than pure numbers. The variables in Python serves the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a variable?\n",
    "Variable is a name item (a container) used to hold a value. What’s a variable in computer? Memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value stored in the compute memory (RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "You use an assignment statement to bind a value to a name -- also called variable declaration or variable definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "`variable = expression` \n",
    "\n",
    "In this statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `variable` is the name of the variable. The name must be in the left hand side (LHS) of the statement.\n",
    "- `=` is the **assignment operator**. It binds/defines the LHS name to a value. There is a space before and after the operator for better code format.\n",
    "- `expression` is a value or an operation that produces a value. It is in the right hand side (RHS) of the statement.\n",

    "## 2.2 Indetifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [Two hard things blog](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html):\n",
    ">There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">-- Phil Karlton\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be exaggerated, but naming is really one of the most important decisions in programming. You should think hard to give a variable the most meaningful name thus you and other people can understand the value behind it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has simple but strict rules for variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A name must be started with a letter in the range of `a` through `z`, or `A` through `Z`, or an underscore character `_`.\n",
    "- The rest of the name can be any letters in the range of `a` through `z`, `A` through `Z`, 0 through 9, or an underscore character `_`.\n",
    "- The variable name is case sensitive. `score`, `scorE` and `Score` are all different names.\n",
    "- Python keywords such as `if`, `for` cannot be used as variable names because they have special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "`x`, `x9`, `_proxy`, `__all__`, `i18n`, `ohmygod`, `course_name` are all valid names because they obey the naming rules. However, `9x`, `42`, `@name`, `My**key`, `price$` are invalid names because they don't start with a valid letter or have invalid letters in the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-word Names\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, names such as `studentname`, `roomnumber` are clumsy to read and write. Programmers use special terms to describe the multi-word naming mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `snake_case`: use underscore to seperate each lower case word. It is recommended for naming multi-word variables and source code files in Python.\n",
    "- `kebab-case`: use a dash to seperate lower case words.\n",
    "- `PascalCasing`: each word starts with an uppercase letter.\n",
    "- `camelCasing`: only the first word start with a lower case letter, others start with an upperc case letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses underscore letter `_` to seperate words in names. The naming conventions are defined in [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magic Nubmers\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    ">  written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should aovid using number literals in your code. Whenever it appears, give it a name. For example,\n",

    "Another benefit of defining constant variables is that you only need to change one place and all its usage will be changes. For example, if the Pi value is used in many places and you define it as `PI = 3.1`. Later you want to use the value of `3.14`, you only need to change the defintion as `PI = 3.14` in one place.

    "Deleting unused objects is an automatic process called **garbage collection** that helps to keep the memory of the computer less utilized.\n",

    "## 2.8 Module\n",
    "\n",
    "A `module` is a Pyhon code file. Or you can say a Python file is a module. A module usually consists of a set of closely-related functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses three constructs to organize an application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a funtion to group statements, in a source code file.\n",
    "- a module to group functions in a Python source code file. One file is a module.\n",
    "- a pacakge to group files, usually in one or more folders. A folder can be a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is rather simple, putting all functions into a single file is not appropirate for big programs. Putting functions into diffrent files are easy to read/write and easy to collaborate. Packages are used to organize a large functional area. For example, all math functions or network requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it simple, we put all modules in the same folder. In real applications, you may want to use foders to organize files into packages. For beginners, a fold with multiple Python scripts files/modules should be enough to write a non-trivial program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a module, you use `import module_name` to import a module. The module name is the Python script file name with the `.py` postfix. Then you can use `module_name.function_name` to call a function defined in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "When a module is imported, Python executes the statements in the module. For example, if you change the `constants.py` to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# constants.py\n",
    "PI = 3.1416\n",
    "\n",
    "print('PI is define')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the `import constants` will execute the two statemens: define a variable and print a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you import a file multiple times, Python only executes it once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditionally Execute `main`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a mechanims to distinguish the two execution modes. When the Python interpreter processes a module, it creates a special variable named `__name__`. It is a convention in Python that variable names started with `_` or `__` are used by the system. The `__name_` has two possible values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a module is imported by another module, its `__name__` has a value of the module name, i.e., the filename without the `.py` postfix. For example, if the `circle` module was imported, its `__name__` has a value of `circle`.\n",
    "- If it is executed by Python interprete in command line, the `__name__` has a value of `__main__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    print('Execute as a cript')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Imported as a module')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to run the file in a command line and import it from another module. You should see the test output in commandline but not in the imported file.\n"
